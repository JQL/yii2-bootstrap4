## How to:
These are step-by-step instructions but they assume you have some knowledge of web programming, PHP, HTML, CSS and dtabase setup.
1. Download and install Composer if you haven't already done so: https://getcomposer.org/download/
2. Update Composer if required (version 2 required): `composer selfupdate`
3. Download Yii2 BASIC into the **bootstrap4** folder of your **_htdocs_** folder: `composer create-project --prefer-dist yiisoft/yii2-app-basic bootstrap4`
4. Create a database called **bootstrap4**.
5. Open Yii2 Basic in your favourite editor. For the video we're using NetBeans (https://netbeans.apache.org/)
6. In _config/web.php_ uncomment the 'urlManager' section to enable Pretty Urls
7. In _config/db.php_ enter your database details:
```
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=bootstrap4',
    'username' => 'root', // enter your username
    'password' => '',     // enter your password
    'charset' => 'utf8',

    // Schema cache options (for production environment)
    //'enableSchemaCache' => true,
    //'schemaCacheDuration' => 60,
    //'schemaCache' => 'cache',
];
```

8. Check that everything is working in your browser: http://localhost/bootstrap4/web/index.php You should see the Yii2 Home Page. Open all the pages on the menu to check they are working correctly.
9. Create some dummy data for the database. Either download the SQL file or create a migration. **Either** run the sql in your database manager: https://github.com/JQL/yii2-bootstrap4/blob/main/bootstrap4.sql **Or** copy the _migrations_ folder: https://github.com/JQL/yii2-bootstrap4/tree/main/migrations and place it in the root of the _bootstrap4_ folder and run ```./yii migrate```. **_Do Not Do Both_**
